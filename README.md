# gvp-fish

A fish-friendly source version of [gvp](https://github.com/pote/gvp)'s `gvp in` and `gvp out` commands.

## Installation

Currently there are no automated installation options. However, `gvp-fish` is 
just a fish script.  Put it wherever you want.

## Usage

Fish requires a file to be sourced directly, rather than the file found in 
`$PATH`. Example:

```
source /usr/local/bin/gvp-fish in
```

Where `/usr/local/bin/gvp-fish` is wherever you installed the fish script.
